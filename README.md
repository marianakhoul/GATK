# Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)
The GATK is the industry standard for identifying SNPs and indels in germline DNA and RNAseq data. Its scope is now expanding to include somatic short variant calling, and to tackle copy number (CNV) and structural variation (SV). In addition to the variant callers themselves, the GATK also includes many utilities to perform related tasks such as processing and quality control of high-throughput sequencing data, and bundles the popular Picard toolkit.

It is a collection of command-line tools for analyzing high-throughput seqiencing data with a primary focus on variant discovery.Tools can be used individually or chained together into complete workflows.

This page contains the GATK best practice pipelines.

Order of process
1. Map and clean up short read sequence data effectively
2. Data pre-processing for variant discovery
